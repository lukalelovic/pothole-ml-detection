# Pothole ML Detection
Machine learning image classifier for road potholes.

## Motivation
The basis behind this project comes from an interest in urban planning and making improvements to cities and the ways in which we interact with them. If this could be automated (i.e. through machine learning), government departments could be better equipped with tools and information to improve their cities.

## Dataset
This project utilizes the simplex pothole dataset provided by Sovit Ranjan Rath found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sovitrath/road-pothole-images-for-pothole-detection).
